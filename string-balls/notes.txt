if we make sure that each character has an instance for each possible direction
on the second iteration, then we can create instances where we assign directions again

> ball
we create
ball ball ball ball ball ball ball
v    ^     ^     v    ^     v    ^

Then on the second level we generate aall, then we do the following

aall aall aall aall aall
v^   v v  v ^  v  v v  ^

If we have restrictions on the directions, then we can avoid going backwards
